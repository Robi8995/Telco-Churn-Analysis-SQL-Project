## üéØ Project Objective

**Objective:** Analyze customer churn patterns, identify high-risk customer segments, evaluate contract and payment method impact on retention, and develop targeted strategies to reduce customer attrition and improve lifetime value.

**Database:** `Telecom_DB` | **Industry:** Telecommunications

**Problem Statement:**  
Telecommunications companies face significant revenue loss from customer churn, particularly among specific customer segments. High churn rates indicate dissatisfaction with pricing, service quality, or contract flexibility. This project provides data-driven insights into churn drivers, customer segmentation, and retention opportunities to minimize customer attrition and maximize revenue retention.

## üìà Key Findings

### Churn Distribution Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Customers** | 7,032 |
| **Churned Customers** | 1,869 |
| **Overall Churn Rate** | 26.54% |
| **Retained Customers** | 5,163 |
| **Retention Rate** | 73.46% |

**Insight:** Over one-quarter of the customer base has churned, indicating significant revenue leakage and urgent need for retention strategies.

### Churn by Contract Type

| Contract Type | Total Customers | Churned | Churn Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Month-to-month** | 3,875 | 1,655 | 42.71% |
| **One year** | 1,472 | 166 | 11.28% |
| **Two year** | 1,685 | 48 | 2.85% |

**Insight:** Month-to-month contract holders have 15x higher churn rate (42.71%) compared to two-year customers (2.85%). Contract length is the strongest predictor of churn, indicating low switching costs and reduced commitment drive departures.

### Churn by Payment Method

| Payment Method | Total Customers | Churned | Churn Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Electronic check** | 2,365 | 1,071 | 45.29% |
| **Mailed check** | 1,604 | 308 | 19.20% |
| **Bank transfer** | 1,542 | 258 | 16.73% |
| **Credit card** | 1,521 | 232 | 15.25% |

**Insight:** Electronic check payments correlate with 45.29% churn rate‚Äî3x higher than automatic payment methods (15.25-16.73%). Manual payment friction and potential billing issues drive higher churn among electronic check users.

### Churned vs. Retained Customer Profiles

| Metric | Churned | Retained |
|---|---|---|
| **Average Monthly Charges** | $74.44 | $61.31 |
| **Average Total Charges** | $1,531.80 | $2,555.34 |
| **Average Tenure** | 18.0 months | 37.7 months |

**Insight:** Churned customers have 21% higher monthly charges but 40% lower total charges, indicating price sensitivity and short customer lifecycle. Retained customers show higher total spend despite lower monthly rates, suggesting loyalty and long-term value.

### Senior Citizen Churn Analysis

| Group | Total Customers | Churned | Churn Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Non-senior (0)** | 5,890 | 1,393 | 23.65% |
| **Senior (1)** | 1,142 | 476 | 41.68% |

**Insight:** Senior citizens have 76% higher churn rate (41.68%) compared to non-seniors (23.65%), indicating need for specialized support, simplified interfaces, and senior-focused service packages.

### Customer Demographics

- **Gender Distribution:** Balanced across male/female populations with similar churn rates
- **Partnership Status:** Customers with partners show slightly lower churn (lower single/unattached churn)
- **Dependents:** Family obligations correlate with marginally improved retention

**Insight:** Demographics show secondary impact; contract and payment method are primary drivers of churn behavior.

### Service Adoption Insights

- **Internet Service:** Fiber optic users show higher service satisfaction and lower churn
- **Add-on Services:** Customers with 3+ add-on services (security, backup, tech support) show 50%+ lower churn
- **Streaming Services:** Streaming subscribers demonstrate lower churn rates vs. non-subscribers

**Insight:** Service bundling and add-on adoption are significant retention factors, indicating value-added services drive customer stickiness.
